# Google Sheet And Jira Integration
The purpose of this capstone project is to provide our client, SiFive, the ability to enable Google Sheets to have Jira update capabilities as an add-on option. Currently, users can import their Jira data onto a Google Sheet via the downloadable Jira Cloud for Sheets extension but they are not able to send updates back to Jira through Google Sheets. Our goal is to maximize the effectiveness of our client’s key processes that utilize Google Sheets with Jira data by providing them a successful Jira-Google Sheets add-on integration solution that will meet their needs and required specifications.
	SiFive designs custom semiconductors and silicon chips for commercial use and implements a RISC-V instruction set architecture in their processors.  Due to the nature of their work, they employ teams of engineers from various disciplines to design their RISC-V core products and use the issue and project tracking software, Jira, to help manage their projects. They have expressed great interest in this project and would like to be able to integrate a Jira-Google Sheets add-on integration solution into their workflow. Besides supporting our client’s needs, this project would also benefit those looking to integrate Google Sheets data to Jira without having to resort to paying for expensive integration software or compromise their data privacy using a third-party application.
